# AR-Sea-Battle

This is AR Sea Battle based on ARCore. The project was created as a Kotlin programming term paper. The project was abandoned because the idea eventually ceased to be relevant and the method of the program was experimental but unsuccessful. It has menu, permissions requesting and ar scene. Player can play only against AI, but there is some code which allows to set local net.
